# advice-generator

It gets random advice from the API with fetch, and the advice changes every time when you click the dice. I tried to make it compatible with different 
devices by making a responsive design. The process was very enjoyable from start to finish.
It allows the user to see random advice.
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Advice Slip API.
